                <p>An unplanned eccentric orbit resulted from a brief second-stage burn. Aside from that, the spacecraft and its experiments ran smoothly until September 22, 1964. Because the solar paddles became locked in place, there was insufficient electrical power to continue operations.</p>

                <p>Nimbus 3 was successful and ran normally until the IRIS experiment failed on July 22, 1969. On January 25, 1970, and June 21, 1970, the HRIR and SIRS experiments were terminated, respectively. The remaining experiments ran until September 25, 1970, when the rear horizon scanner broke down. It was impossible to maintain proper spacecraft attitude without this horizon scanner, rendering most experimental observations useless. On January 22, 1972, all spacecraft operations came to an end.</p>
